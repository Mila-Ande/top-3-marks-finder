# Top Three Mark Finder

This is a C++ console application that allows the user to input 10 final marks, stores them in an array, and sorts them in descending order to display the top three highest marks. It demonstrates array manipulation, sorting algorithms using the Standard Template Library (STL), and user input handling.

## 🔧 Features
- Accepts 10 integer marks from the user
- Displays all entered marks
- Sorts the marks in descending order
- Outputs the top three highest marks
- Input validation and basic loop control

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- C++ arrays and loops
- Use of the `sort()` function with `greater<int>()` from `<algorithm>`
- Console input/output using `cin` and `cout`
- Basic user interaction and feedback

## 💻 Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Console application

## 📷 Sample Output
Please enter 10 final marks:
The mark is 1: 78
The mark is 2: 45
...
The final marks are: 78 45 66 89 92 55 40 61 73 88
The top three marks are: 92 89 88
