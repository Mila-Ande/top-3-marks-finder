# top-3-marks-finder
This C++ program allows a user to enter 10 final marks, stores them in an array, and displays the top three highest marks in descending order. It uses sorting with std::sort() and greater&lt;int>() from the STL, making it a good demonstration of array manipulation, user input, and algorithms in C++.
